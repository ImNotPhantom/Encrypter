So make sure you have python install if not just download it, should be https://python.org/downloads

after that make sure you check the box in the install that says add to path, if ther is not just ignore this step

then you should be good, you can type 'pip freeze' to test if it works

then just run the 'Run Me First' program in the bin folder, this should install the requiered modules to run this program.

just wait until it is done then close the window

after that drag and drop a file I.E: .txt, .json, .encfile into the 'Release' directory

then just run the program in release

if you wanna see the program code just open up the 'Encrypter.py' file in the 'Debug' folder an open with
a text editor like atom or vs code

And the program should go something like this:

Encrypt or Decrypt? (e/d): (enter e or d here)

File to encrypt (with the file extention): (enter the file name with the extention like text.txt)
or
File to decrypt (the .encfile's name): (enter the .encfile's name)

and if you choose to decrypt then it will ask you:
Output file name (with the file extention): (enter the file name with the extention like text.txt)

if the file does not exist then it will say that the file does not exist

after that it will tell you your key so keep that in mind

then to decrypt then it will ask for your key so make sure you remeber that

that's all bye
